# Iris Dataset Visualizer

This project contains a simple Python script that loads the classic **Iris dataset**, generates pairwise plots using **Seaborn**, and saves the resulting figure with a timestamped filename.

## Description

The script performs the following tasks:

- Loads the Iris dataset using `seaborn.load_dataset`.
- Creates a `PairGrid` plot with:
  - Histogram plots on the diagonal.
  - Scatter plots off the diagonal.
  - Color-coded species labels.
- Generates a timestamped filename.
- Saves the plot as a PNG image in a specified directory.

## Files

- `iris_overview.py`: Main Python script for generating the pairwise plots.
- Output files: PNG images saved with timestamped filenames (e.g., `output_250528_142301.png`).

## Example Output

Running the script will generate a plot similar to this (plot not shown here) and save it with a filename based on the current date and time.

See output folder for example output file.

Example file name: 

output_250528_142301.png


## Usage

## ðŸ”§ Setting Up the Conda Environment

This project includes a Conda environment specification files (`requirements.yaml`or `exported_env.yaml`) to help you quickly set up the required dependencies.

### ðŸ“¥ Create the Environment

```
conda env create -f requirements.yaml
```   
alternatively:
```
conda env create -f exported_env.yaml
```

### Alternative Pip Requirements

- Python 3
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib (Seaborn dependency)

You can install the required package with:

```
pip install seaborn
```
## Running the Script
Run the script using:


```
python3 iris_overview.py
```

```
python script/iris_overview.py
  ```
